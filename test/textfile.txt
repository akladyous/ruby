All variables in the current scope (including global variables) are passed to templates as Ruby instance variables, which begin with “at” signs (@). If you can access a variable by its short name in the surrounding manifest, you can access it in the template by replacing its $ sign with an @, so that $os becomes @os, and $trusted becomes @trusted.
